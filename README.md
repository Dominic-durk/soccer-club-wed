Project Description: Soccer Club Website is a dynamic web application designed to manage and display key information for a soccer club, aimed at both fans and club members. The purpose of this website is to provide an easy-to-navigate interface where users can view:
                    Upcoming and past match schedules.
                    Player profiles and team roster.
                    Latest news and announcements.
                    Club contact information.
By organizing all relevant information into one platform, the website enhances communication within the club and provides fans with the latest updates.
Problem Solved
Before this website, the club relied on separate platforms for managing match schedules, player data, and news. This web application consolidates all of that into one user-friendly platform, streamlining information sharing and improving engagement between the club and its members or supporters.
The purpose of this soccer club web application is to create an interactive platform for soccer fans, players, and potential members to engage with the club.
